# Hey you! 👋

I'm a Data Architect at Grendene S/A, where I design and implement scalable data ingestion architectures using Google Cloud Platform. I also help administer the Power BI Fabric environment. Furthermore, I contribute to continuous improvements and perform production deployments.

I support the adoption of the data mesh model in the company, contributing to the productization of domain-oriented data, defining best practices for decentralized governance, and providing technical support to teams in the construction of data products.

I'm in the 8th semester of the Computer Science program at La Salle University, expanding my technical and strategic knowledge in data and engineering.

I have solid experience in development and data infrastructure maintenance, focusing on building efficient data pipelines, optimizing databases, and developing scalable solutions.
